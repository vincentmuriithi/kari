## Kari object files 

The following folders contain object files for the kari library and have been labelled with a version number. It however good to note that you do not need them inorder to use the kari library and they do not affect your usage of the kari arduino library.

That's been said it means you do not need to include this folder during your kari installation and should only follow the installation guidelines as provided in the [official kari documentation](https://github.com/vincentmuriithi/kari). However the files are provided to enable other developers with compliance with the licence terms and conditions used to license kari to extend or add theirown  custom features in their own projects if they wish to do so.
